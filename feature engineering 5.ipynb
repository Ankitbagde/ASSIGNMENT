    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two techniques for encoding categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category based on its order or rank in the data.\n",
    "For example, if we have a categorical feature with the categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" \n",
    "we can assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to these categories, respectively. Ordinal encoding preserves the order \n",
    "or hierarchy of the categories, which can be useful in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without any regard to order or hierarchy. \n",
    "For example, we could assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to the categories \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" respectively,\n",
    "without any implication that one color is \"higher\" or \"lower\" than another. Label encoding is useful for algorithms \n",
    "that require numerical inputs, but do not benefit from ordinal information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One scenario where ordinal encoding might be preferred is in the case of an ordinal categorical variable, where \n",
    "the categories have a natural order or hierarchy. For example, the categories \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" for income \n",
    "levels have a natural order, and it may be useful to preserve this order in the encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if there is no natural order or hierarchy among the categories, such as in the case of colors, \n",
    "label encoding might be preferred.\n",

    "In summary, the choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the specific characteristics of the \n",
