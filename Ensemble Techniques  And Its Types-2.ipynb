    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is a popular ensemble learning technique that reduces overfitting in decision trees \n",
    "by creating multiple independent bootstrap samples of the original data set and building a decision tree model on \n",
    "each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing variance: When decision trees are grown deep, they tend to overfit the training data by capturing noise or \n",
    "    random fluctuations in the data. Bagging helps to reduce variance by aggregating multiple decision trees built \n",
    "    on different bootstrap samples, which reduces the impact of the noise on the final decision. The output of bagging is an average of the individual decision trees, which tends to be more stable and less sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving generalization: Bagging also helps to improve generalization by creating multiple independent data sets. \n",
    "    Since each decision tree is trained on a different bootstrap sample, it is likely to capture different aspects \n",
    "    of the data. By combining the output of all the decision trees, bagging provides a more accurate prediction on the test data, which is less likely to be biased by a single decision tree.\n",
