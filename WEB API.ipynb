    "1.Reusability: APIs can be reused by multiple applications, which saves time and effort in development.\n",

    "1.Complexity: APIs can be complex to design and implement, requiring significant technical expertise.\n",

    "3.Dependencies: APIs can create dependencies between applications, which can make it more difficult to change or replace them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintenance: APIs require ongoing maintenance and support to ensure they remain secure and reliable over time."
