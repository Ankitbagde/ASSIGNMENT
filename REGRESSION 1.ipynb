    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the errors (the difference between the predicted values and the actual values) \n",
    "    should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals \n",
    "    should be the same throughout the range of the independent variable.\n",

    "Correlation matrix: A correlation matrix can be used to check for multicollinearity. If the correlation coefficients\n",
