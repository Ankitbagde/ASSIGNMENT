    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting differ in several key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Infrastructure: Traditional web hosting typically involves a single physical server or a small cluster of servers \n",
    "    located in a data center. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, is built on a network of virtual servers that are \n",
    "    hosted in data centers around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: With traditional web hosting, resources are limited to the capacity of the physical servers. \n",
    "    If more resources are needed, additional servers must be added, which can be costly and time-consuming. \n",
    "    In contrast, cloud hosting allows resources to be easily scaled up or down as needed, with the ability to add\n",
    "    or remove virtual servers on-demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Cost: Traditional web hosting typically involves a fixed monthly or yearly fee, regardless of the amount of \n",
    "    resources used. With cloud hosting, costs are typically based on usage, with users paying only for the \n",
    "    resources they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Reliability: Traditional web hosting can be less reliable, as downtime can occur if the physical servers fail \n",
    "    or become overloaded. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, is designed for high availability and reliability,\n",
    "    with automatic failover and redundancy built-in to ensure uptime.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Management: With traditional web hosting, users are typically responsible for managing and maintaining the\n",
    "    servers themselves, including software updates, security patches, and backups. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, \n",
    "    provides managed services, with the cloud provider handling most of the maintenance and management tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, cloud hosting offers more flexibility, scalability, and reliability than traditional web hosting, while \n",
